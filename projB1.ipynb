In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n\nAfter this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n\n- Feature engineering with text data,\n- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models, and\n- Validate the performance of your model and minimize overfitting.\n\nThis first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, Feature Engineering, and Logistic Regression. In the second part of this project (to be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n\n## Content Warning\nThis is a **real-world** dataset – the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails.

The dataset is from [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/). It consists of email messages and their labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam). Your labeled training dataset contains 8,348 labeled examples, and the unlabeled test set contains 1,000 unlabeled examples.\n\n**Note:** The dataset is from 2004, so the contents of emails might be very different from those in 2023.\n\nRun the following cells to load the data into a `DataFrame`.\n\nThe `train` `DataFrame` contains labeled data you will use to train your model. It has four columns:\n\n1. `id`: An identifier for the training example.\n1. `subject`: The subject of the email.\n1. `email`: The text of the email.\n1. `spam`: 1 if the email is spam, 0 if the email is ham (not spam).\n\nThe `test` `DataFrame` contains 1,000 unlabeled emails.

Make sure only to consider emails from `train`. Your `words_in_texts` function from the previous part will be useful here. \n\n**Hint:** This is a pretty challenging question. The suggested approach is to first look at the example bar plot and make sure you can interpret what is being plotted - what does a bar represent? What does the height mean? \n\nNext, see how to make this plot with `sns.barplot`. Take a look at the ([documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html)) and determine what the inputs should be. A possible data input is given below:\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">  <thead>    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">      <th></th>      <th>type</th>      <th>variable</th>      <th>value</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    \n<tr>      <th>0</th>      <td>Ham</td>      <td>word_1</td>      <td>0.021269</td>    </tr>    \n<tr>      <th>1</th>      <td>Ham</td>      <td>word_2</td>      <td>0.101519</td>    </tr>    \n<tr>      <th>2</th>      <td>Spam</td>      <td>word_3</td>      <td>0.059160</td>    </tr>    \n<tr>      <th>3</th>      <td>Spam</td>      <td>word_2</td>      <td>0.017694</td>    </tr>    \n<tr>      <th>4</th>      <td>Ham</td>      <td>word_4</td>      <td>0.013226</td>    </tr>     \n<tr>      <th>...</th>      <td>...</td>      <td>...</td>      <td>...</td>    </tr>    \n</tbody></table>\n\nFinally, you will need to chain some `pandas` functions together. Try to add one function at a time and see how that affects the `DataFrame`. It may help to use a new cell or print out the `DataFrame` for debugging purposes as you work towards achieving the desired format above.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- BEGIN

But the classifier you made above isn't as good as the accuracy would make you believe. First, we are evaluating the accuracy of the model on the training set, which may provide a misleading accuracy measure. Accuracy on the training set doesn't always translate to accuracy in the real world (on the test set). In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n\nPresumably, our classifier will be used for **filtering**, i.e., preventing messages labeled `spam` from reaching someone's inbox. There are two kinds of errors we can make:\n- **False positive (FP)**: A ham email gets flagged as spam and filtered out of the inbox.\n- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n\nTo be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels. False positives and false negatives may be of differing importance, leading us to consider more ways of evaluating a classifier in addition to overall accuracy:\n\n**Precision**: Measures the proportion of emails flagged as spam that are actually spam. Mathematically, $\\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FP}}$.\n\n**Recall**: Measures the proportion  of spam emails that were correctly flagged as spam. Mathematically, $\\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}}$.\n\n**False positive rate**: Measures the proportion  of ham emails that were incorrectly flagged as spam. Mathematically, $\\frac{\\text{FP}}{\\text{FP} + \\text{TN}}$.\n\nOne quick mnemonic to remember the formulas is that **P**recision involves T**P** and F**P**, Recall does not. In the final, the reference sheet will also contain the formulas shown above, but you should be able to interpret what they mean and their importance depending on the context.\n\nThe below graphic (modified slightly from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)) may help you understand precision and recall visually:<br />\n<center>\n<img alt=\"precision_recall\" src=\"images/precision_recall.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n</center>\n\nNote that a True Positive (TP) is a spam email that is classified as spam, and a True Negative (TN) is a ham email that is classified as ham.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>\n\n---\n\n## Question 6a\n\nSuppose we have a hypothetical classifier called the “zero predictor.” For any inputted email, the zero predictor *always* predicts 0 (it never makes a prediction of 1 for any email).
